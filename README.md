EARTH LISTENER


Ever wondered how good the air quality is in your living room? Or do you need proof of why you fall asleep in a non-ventilated meeting room after 3 hours? Look no further! This DIY experimental kit has all the answers!
The Earth Listener is an Arduino based sensor device that reads multiple environmental values to indicate the air quality. This kit is assembled in 15 minutes and you donâ€™t need a soldering iron! Just connect the parts and wires, put everything in the case and connect it to a 5V USB socket. The Mega development board is pre-programmed and shows eCO2, TVOC (particles in the air), barometric pressure, temperature and humidity values onto the TFT touchscreen. To top thing off, the Earth Listener also contains a lightning detection sensor. If lightning (or electronic discharge) is detected, the Earth Listener will give an alarm tone and log how far the lightning is located. Since everything is open source, you can add an additional 6 sensors to the Earth Listener via the sensor shield. Logging is possible via the micro SD card (not included).
